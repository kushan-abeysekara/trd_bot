📋 **Trading Bot Troubleshooting Guide**

## ✅ Bot Status: **WORKING CORRECTLY**

Your trading bot is actually functioning properly! Here's what's happening:

### **Why the Bot Isn't Trading:**

1. **Strategy is Very Conservative** 🛡️
   - The "Adaptive Mean Reversion Rebound" strategy has strict conditions
   - It only trades when market conditions are perfect for mean reversion
   - This is designed to maintain high win rates

2. **Current Market Conditions** 📊
   - RSI is outside the 48-52 range (currently monitoring)
   - Waiting for price to touch Bollinger Bands
   - Need specific volatility and momentum conditions

### **How to Monitor Real-Time Conditions:**

#### **Real-Time Strategy Monitor** 📊
- The dashboard now includes a live monitoring window
- Shows current technical indicators vs target ranges
- Real-time condition tracking with visual indicators
- Signal analysis showing conditions met (x/4)
- Live updates every 5 seconds

#### **Strategy Conditions Display** 🎯
Monitor these conditions in the Real-Time Strategy Monitor:
- **RSI Range**: 48-52 (shows current value with ✓/✗ indicator)
- **Volatility**: 1.0-1.5% (live percentage with status)
- **Momentum**: < ±0.2% (current reading with validation)
- **MACD**: -0.1 to +0.1 (flat condition indicator)

### **How to See Trading Activity:**

#### **Option 1: Use Real-Time Monitor** ⏳
- Watch the "Real-Time Strategy Monitor" in the dashboard
- All 4 conditions must show ✓ (green checkmarks)
- Then wait for "Bollinger Band Touch" signal
- Bot will auto-trade when conditions align

#### **Option 2: Adjust Strategy Settings** ⚙️
To make the bot trade more frequently, you can:

1. **Relax RSI Range**: Change from 48-52 to 40-60
2. **Increase Volatility Range**: Change from 1-1.5% to 0.5-2%
3. **Adjust Momentum Threshold**: Change from ±0.2% to ±0.5%

#### **Option 3: Test with Manual Data** 🧪
Use the test script to generate specific market conditions:

```bash
cd backend
python test_bot.py
```

### **Current Issues to Fix:**

#### **1. ChatGPT API Key** 🔑
- Current key is invalid (401 error)
- Get a new key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
- Update in `backend/routes/ai_analysis.py` and `backend/services/market_analyzer.py`

#### **2. Frontend Dashboard** 🖥️
To see real-time bot status:

1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && python app.py`
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. **Open**: http://localhost:3000
4. **Setup API Token** in the dashboard
5. **Start Bot** from the dashboard
6. **Monitor Real-Time Window** for live conditions

### **Quick Start Commands:**

```bash
# Windows
cd d:\GITHUB\trd_bot
setup_and_run.bat

# Linux/Mac
cd /path/to/trd_bot
./setup_and_run.sh
```

### **Verify Bot is Working:**

```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/api/trading-bot/test
curl http://localhost:5000/api/trading-bot/status
```

### **Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ Bot starts and connects to Deriv WebSocket
- ✅ Receives real-time price data
- ✅ Shows "Strategy Status: Monitoring Conditions"
- ✅ Real-time monitor shows live technical indicators
- ✅ Conditions tracker shows x/4 conditions met
- ✅ Will trade when all conditions align and BB touch occurs
- ✅ Displays live data in dashboard

### **Real-Time Monitoring Features:**

- 🎯 **Strategy Status**: Live strategy state and current conditions
- 📊 **Technical Indicators**: Real-time RSI, Volatility, Momentum, MACD
- ✅ **Condition Tracker**: Visual indicators for each requirement
- 🎮 **Signal Analysis**: Shows readiness for trading opportunities
- ⚡ **Live Updates**: Refreshes every 5 seconds automatically

### **Make Bot Trade More Often:**

If you want to see more trading activity, consider:

1. **Use Demo Mode**: Lower stakes, more experimental
2. **Adjust Settings**: Less conservative parameters
3. **Multiple Strategies**: Add trend-following alongside mean reversion
4. **Different Markets**: Try multiple volatility indices
