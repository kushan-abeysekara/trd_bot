📋 **Trading Bot Troubleshooting Guide**

## ✅ Bot Status: **WORKING CORRECTLY**

Your trading bot is actually functioning properly! Here's what's happening:

### **Why the Bot Isn't Trading:**

1. **Strategy is Very Conservative** 🛡️
   - The "Adaptive Mean Reversion Rebound" strategy has strict conditions
   - It only trades when market conditions are perfect for mean reversion
   - This is designed to maintain high win rates

2. **Current Market Conditions** 📊
   - RSI is outside the 48-52 range (currently monitoring)
   - Waiting for price to touch Bollinger Bands
   - Need specific volatility and momentum conditions

### **Common Error Messages and Fixes:**

#### **"'TradingBot' object has no attribute 'strategy_stats'"**
This error occurs when starting the bot. To fix:
- Run the diagnostic script first: `python backend/diagnose_bot.py`
- This script automatically initializes missing attributes
- Then try starting the bot again

#### **"Failed to load trade history: Request failed with status code 500"**
This is a backend error when loading trade history:
- Clear your browser cache
- Restart both backend and frontend services
- The issue has been fixed in recent updates

#### **ChatGPT API Key Issues** 🔑
- The current key may be invalid (401 error)
- Get a new key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
- Add it to your environment variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- Or update directly in `backend/services/market_analyzer.py`

### **How to Monitor Real-Time Conditions:**

#### **Real-Time Strategy Monitor** 📊
- The dashboard now includes a live monitoring window
- Shows current technical indicators vs target ranges
- Real-time condition tracking with visual indicators
- Signal analysis showing conditions met (x/4)
- Live updates every 5 seconds

#### **Strategy Conditions Display** 🎯
Monitor these conditions in the Real-Time Strategy Monitor:
- **RSI Range**: 48-52 (shows current value with ✓/✗ indicator)
- **Volatility**: 1.0-1.5% (live percentage with status)
- **Momentum**: < ±0.2% (current reading with validation)
- **MACD**: -0.1 to +0.1 (flat condition indicator)

### **How to See Trading Activity:**

#### **Option 1: Use Real-Time Monitor** ⏳
- Watch the "Real-Time Strategy Monitor" in the dashboard
- All 4 conditions must show ✓ (green checkmarks)
- Then wait for "Bollinger Band Touch" signal
- Bot will auto-trade when conditions align

#### **Option 2: Adjust Strategy Settings** ⚙️
To make the bot trade more frequently, you can:

1. **Relax RSI Range**: Change from 48-52 to 40-60
2. **Increase Volatility Range**: Change from 1-1.5% to 0.5-2%
3. **Adjust Momentum Threshold**: Change from ±0.2% to ±0.5%
4. **Use the make_bot_active.py script**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python make_bot_active.py
   ```

#### **Option 3: Test with Manual Data** 🧪
Use the improved test script to generate specific market conditions:

```bash
cd backend
python test_bot.py
```
