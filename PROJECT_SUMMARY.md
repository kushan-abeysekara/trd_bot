- **Dynamic Stake Calculation**:
  - Account balance protection (max 2% per trade)
  - Volatility-based adjustments
  - Consecutive loss/win adjustments
  - Performance-based scaling
- **Multi-layered Risk Protection**:
  - Daily stop loss (configurable %)
  - Daily target limits
  - Maximum stake limits
  - Real-time balance monitoring

### 🛡️ Safety & Risk Management

#### Comprehensive Safety System
- **Daily Limits**: Stop loss (10%) and target (20%) protection

### 🔄 Multi-Strategy Core

#### Three Switchable Trading Modes
- **Mode A: MA-RSI Trend Bot**: Moving average + RSI filter for trending markets
- **Mode B: Price Action Bounce**: Reversal strategy for sideways markets  
- **Mode C: Random Entry Smart Exit**: Random entry with intelligent risk management

#### Intelligent Strategy Switching
- After 3 wins → Switch to Mode C for 2 trades
- After 2 losses → Switch to Mode B for 3 trades
- Every 10 trades → Re-evaluate best performer
